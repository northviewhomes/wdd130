    <p>Hi Everyone, this is so fun!! I'm happy to meet you.<p/>
    This is My Family  </p>
       <img src="images/capture10.jpg" alt=""> 
       <p>I've been married to my eternal companion for 26 years and my boys are 21 and 18.
        Together we love to ride motorcycles, play games, and laugh. <p/>
        This is my 2nd year @ BYU Idaho and I'm taking this class to help my husband build
        a website for his construction business.  I'm not really pursuing a career, just taking
        classes to learn new things</p>
        <p>I currently work full time as a school bus driver and a virtual receptionist at
             an orthodontist in Southern California even though we live in North Ogden Utah. <p/>
        <p>I was born into the church and a lifetime member.  My favorite scripture is D&C 121:7-8<p/>
